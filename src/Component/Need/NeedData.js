        descrip: "Biofeedback is a mind-body technique that helps people become more aware of their body's functions and learn to control them. It uses electronic or other instruments to measure physiological or biomechanical parameters, such as breathing, heart rate, muscle tension, and brain waves, and then transforms the data into a visual, auditory, or haptic signal. The goal is to help people manipulate their body's systems at will.",

        title: "Neurofeedback",
        descrip: "Neurofeedback (NF) is a non-invasive treatment that uses brain activity data to help people develop healthier brain patterns. It's a type of biofeedback that uses operant conditioning to reinforce desired brain states by presenting a subject with real-time brain activity data through visual, auditory, or tactile means. The subject then tries to voluntarily or involuntarily change these parameters to reach a desired state of brain functioning. The goal is to change how a person thinks and feels, and to change the brain on a biological level to improve its functioning.",
