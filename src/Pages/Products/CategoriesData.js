However, anyone that is interested in getting objective information about how things move can benefit from our technology. For example, our motion capture systems can be used to find and prevent injuries, improve performance in biomechanics and help engineers build better products and increase production efficiency.",
                description: "Our optical tracking technology, also known as optical motion capture, makes it possible to measure the position of very fast moving objects with extremely high accuracy. Indoor, outdoor, ground-to-air or underwater – no matter what condition, we have your solution. The technology consists of motion capture cameras, software and other hardware, designed and produced by our team of experienced engineers.",
